CS 5200 Project Back End Repository
By Javesh Monga and Ayush Shukla

This repository contains the back end python flask middleware services in servery.py as well as our MySql data dump file.

Dev Envirenment setup:
1) First make sure you have python 2.7.16 installed
  you can download it from here https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2716/
  (this installation will also install pip). Also install mysql (along with MySql Workbench) on your pc.
2) Then run the MySql Dump file called gotdump.sql in workbench to get the schema as well as all the data of our application.
3) To install the dependencies run $ pip install -r requirements.txt in the project directory.
4) Now to configure the local database to run with the python flask server, set the following environment variables accordingly (a sample values is given below)
    DBUSERNAME = 'root'
    DBPASSWORD = 'root'
    DBSCHEMA = 'gameofthrones' (this must be 'gameofthrones' as our dump creates a schema of that name)
    DBHOSTNAME = localhost (would be localhost if running locally)
    
    Alternatively you can also change these values directly in server.py, under the comment #MySQL configurations.
    
5)Run Python server.py

The app will start running on localhost:5000
